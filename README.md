# Inverse Modeling Demo!

This code reproduces Roesler and Perry 1995 "In situ phytoplankton absorption, fluorescence emission, and particulate backscattering spectra determined from reflectance": https://doi.org/10.1029/95JC00455

The code is directly ported from matlab code written by Collin Roesler and was designed for a lab in the NASA/UMaine Ocean Optics Course.

What is scattering?

Can we differentiate phyto species?
